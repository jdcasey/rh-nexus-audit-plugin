CapturePlugin.init()
 - Create new capture repository group
 - Register new repository type descriptor for path = /capture/*
 - Register new repository for each group/tag where repo-id = {tag}, type = CaptureM2GroupRepository.class
    * Need some way to specify the composition of MEAD repos in each capture repo
    * Need some way to specify the capture source (probably will be something like /groups/capture-source, and will include central, etc.)

CaptureM2GroupRepository.doRetrieve()
 - establish a build-id:
    * require build-name in path structure
    * if build-number provided in path structure, combine with build-name for build-id
    * else, combine logged-in username with build-name for build-id
 - try to resolve from MEAD repos proxied
 - if not found:
    * look for capture-proxy repository with id == build-id
    * if not found, create capture-proxy repository to proxy the capture-target repo/group, and register it.
    * call retrieveItem() on the capture-proxy repository
